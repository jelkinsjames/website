    <h1>Hello and welcome to my first web page!</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Julian Elkins James. I am a developer working out of 
      Augusta, GA. This website has been created as a personal project 
      to learn more about web development and to act as a central hub 
      for my digital life.  
    </p>
    <p>I am currently working on a few projects for this website. In no particular order, they are:
      <ul>
        <li> A blog </li>
        <li> A portfolio </li>
        <li> A resume </li>
        <li> An easy place for all my music (personal as well as with groups) </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Thank you for visitng and check back soon for updates!
